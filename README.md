# BugTracker

BugTracker, in it’s current state, is an internal web application that functions as a bare-bones issue management system. It was built using the ASP.NET Core framework. For a design pattern I chose MVC because I wanted to learn a common project architecture used in production scenarios. I used Entity Framework core to handle database operations largely because of it’s simple queries. Finally, the real email sender uses an SMTP server with help from the MailKit library. As a consequence of using this project to develop backend skills, the frontend is developed with vanilla Bootstrap and a few basic Javascript functions with help from jQuery. Moving forward I would like to expand my knowledge of frontend technologies by learning Javascript and React.

To use BugTracker go to the URL provided in the about section. On the login page click the “Login as a demo user” link. The demo environment is already seeded with some data. Because the layouts differ depending on the role of the user, I encourage you to log in as an Admin user first.
